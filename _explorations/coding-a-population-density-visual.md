In a recent semester III Data Visualisation class, a student presented [this](https://www.behance.net/gallery/99114047/Population-Density) Population Density graphic as a case study. It is a very well done piece, and I told them that it was not beyond their own abilities given that we had done a Creative coding class the previous semester.

So I took it up as a challenge to show them it could be done.
