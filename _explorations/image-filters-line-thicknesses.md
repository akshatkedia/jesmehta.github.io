A whole riot of image filters resulting from just one single property - the thickness of the line at a point depends on the brightness of the image at that point.

The fun lies in figuring out different ways of generating lines.

Here, horizontal and vertical lines traverse the image, with the thickness varying accordingly.

A random walker creates a convoluted path revealing the image over time.

A polar plot draws circular lines.

Varying the polar plot to create a spiral - a single rotating line.

Changes in the radial resolution create interesting effects.

Increasing complexity - lines that are created as particle trails over a constant vector flowfield.

More particle trails over a flowfield, but the flowfield also varies with time, giving a chaotic set of trails.
