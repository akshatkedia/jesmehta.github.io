The Platonic, Archimedean and other polyhedra are a fascinating study, and a fertile base to start creating various forms from.

By their very properties, they lend themselves to being modular - identical faces, equal lengths, uniform angles, etc.

At the same time, 3D printing the entire solid is time consuming and wasteful. So I turned back to lasercutting principles, and 3D printed flat units that assemble into larger solids. This also limits the waste and damage arising form errors or misprints, since only a small unit is unusable rather than an entire print.

For the first trial, I printed two kinds of square units - with and without an internal structure.
