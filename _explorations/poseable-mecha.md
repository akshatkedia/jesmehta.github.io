# Mecha figures

When your game-designer friend challenges you to create an action figure of a mecha-robo-warrior kind, rather than the fantasy kinds that are all over the market, how can you resist ?

And then to make it stand in various stances, change weaponry, and otherwise stand well.

Fun times ! The mechanics were figured out easily enough. The parts modelled in Fusion 360. The first cut 3D prints here came together well. But what I realised was that I am not a character designer. So someone else will have to come and collaborate with me on this.

But who wouldn't want a deadly mecha warrior posing like a toddler on their desk ?
