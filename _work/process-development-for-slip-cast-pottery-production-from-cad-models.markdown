Brief : To setup a workflow enabling pottery production with designs originating in CAD models, bypassing traditional limitations in complexity and accuracy, eventually leading to ceramic products integrated with electronics and other add-ons.

Areas of work:
Mold and mother-mold design
Generative design
Study of the effects of various parameters on casting in alginate, plaster and clay




Toolset :
Fusion 360 and Grasshopper for modelling
3D printing
Alginate and Plaster casting
Slip casting

Status :
Phase 1 : Proof of concept delivered
Refinement iterations pending
