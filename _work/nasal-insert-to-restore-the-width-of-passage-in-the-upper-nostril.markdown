A patient who had undergone surgical reconstruction due to cleft palate suffered from a contracted nasal passage due to buildup of scar tissue. An expander that applied a continuous dynamic force against the contraction was developed to help increase the passage diameter.

**Areas of work :**

Flexing mechanism suitable for insertion into nostril  
Patient comfort in terms of usage (insertion and removal) as well as allowing comfortable breathing while inserted  
Requisite dynamic force applied to passage - too little would collapse it while too much would damage tissue  
Material safety ![2012](/uploads/2012_0428_162133%20edit2.jpg)
