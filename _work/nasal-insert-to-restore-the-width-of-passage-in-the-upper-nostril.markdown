Brief : A patient who had undergone surgical reconstruction due to cleft palate suffered from a contracted nasal passage due to buildup of scar tissue. An expander that applied a continuous dynamic force against the contraction was developed to help increase the passage diameter.

Areas of work :
Flexing mechanism suitable for insertion into nostril
Patient comfort in terms of usage (insertion and removal) as well as allowing comfortable breathing while inserted
Requisite dynamic force applied to passage - too little would collapse it while too much would damage tissue 
Material safety
