**Brief** :

To create parametric models of infant lower leg and foot to be able to generate individualized braces based on key measurements

To streamline key measurement requirements

To speed up the workflow and improve scalability

**Areas of work :**

Development of parametric model of lower leg and foot based on key measurements

Development of brace based on leg model, with associated closures and fitment details

Development of scripts to generate Voronoi meshes over selected areas of the brace based on lightness, comfort and strength

Testing and comparison of generated braces against 3D scans of the limbs and manually sculpted braces

**Toolset :**

Fusion 360, Rhino3D + Grasshopper

**Status :**

The resulting cycle time per brace has gone from 30 hours of highly skilled labour to 15 mins of data operator work. The product is now under large-scale beta-testing.
